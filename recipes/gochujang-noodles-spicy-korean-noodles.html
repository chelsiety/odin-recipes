    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>50 g spring onion, sliced into thirds, some reserved for garnish</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>250 g chestnut mushrooms, thinly sliced (or any other mushroom available)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Gochujang paste</li>
        <li>600 g (1 1/2 packs) Udon Japanese Style Noodles</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoon rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>150 mL chicken stock</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by adding the rapeseed oil to a large/deep frying pan on a high heat. Allow for the pan to preheat,
            then add the spring onion, red pepper and mushrooms into the pan.</li>

        <li>Stir-fry on a high heat for around 5 minutes, constantly stirring.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, combine the gochujang, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and chicken/veggie stock in a bowl.</li>

        <li>Reduce the heat to medium/low and season the veggies with salt. Add the gochujang/stock mix and garlic into the pan and stir to combine.</li>

        <li>Place the udon noodles into the pan and cover with a lid for 2 minutes. This will allow the noodles to loosen before you try to move them.</li>

        <li>Remove the lid and stir the noodles into the sauce. Continue to cook for around 3 minutes, until the sauce has thickened/reduced and the noodles are cooked.</li>
        
        <li>Top with the reserved thinly sliced spring onion and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
